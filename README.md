# Real-Time Data Processing System for Weather Monitoring

## Overview
This project implements a real-time data processing system to monitor weather conditions and provide summarized insights using rollups and aggregates. The system continuously retrieves weather data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/) and processes it to generate daily summaries, alerts, and visualizations.

## Features
- Fetches weather data for major Indian metros: Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, and Hyderabad.
- Converts temperatures from Kelvin to Celsius.
- Provides daily weather summaries with:
  - Average temperature
  - Maximum temperature
  - Minimum temperature
  - Dominant weather condition
- User-configurable temperature thresholds for alerts.
- Visualizations of daily summaries and alerts.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.9
- SQLite for data storage
- Docker for containerization
- OpenWeatherMap API for weather data
